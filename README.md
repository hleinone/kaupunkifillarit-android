[Kaupunkifillarit.fi](https://kaupunkifillarit.fi) - Helsinki City Bikes Android app
====================================================================================

City bikes rolled to the streets of Helsinki in the summer of 2016. They gained popularity quickly. This popularity was a nuisance so we made a service to check the availability status on all bike stations.
